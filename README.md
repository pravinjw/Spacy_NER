Spacy Demonstration for name entity recognization

Natural Language Processing deals with text data. The amount of text data generated these days is enormous. And, this data if utilized properly can bring many fruitful results. Some of the most important Natural Language Processing applications are Text Analytics, Parts of Speech Tagging, Sentiment Analysis, and Named Entity Recognition. The vast amount of text data contains a huge amount of information. An important aspect of analyzing these text data is the identification of Named Entities.

What is a Named Entity?
A named entity is basically a real-life object which has proper identification and can be denoted with a proper name. Named Entities can be a place, person, organization, time, object, or geographic entity.

For example, named entities would be Roger Federer, Honda city, Samsung Galaxy S10. Named entities are usually instances of entity instances. For example, Roger Federer is an instance of a Tennis Player/person, Honda City is an instance of a car and Samsung Galaxy S10 is an instance of a Mobile Phone. 

Named Entity Recognition:
Named Entity Recognition is the process of NLP which deals with identifying and classifying named entities. The raw and structured text is taken and named entities are classified into persons, organizations, places, money, time, etc. Basically, named entities are identified and segmented into various predefined classes.

NER systems are developed with various linguistic approaches, as well as statistical and machine learning methods. NER has many applications for project or business purposes.
NER model first identifies an entity and then categorizes the entity into the most suitable class. Some of the common types of Named Entities will be:

1. Organisations : NASA, CERN, ISRO, etc

2. Places: Mumbai, New York, Kolkata.

3. Money: 1 Billion Dollars, 50 Great Britain Pounds.

4. Date: 15th August 2020

5. Person: Elon Musk, Richard Feynman, Subhas Chandra Bose.
6. 
Spacy is an open-source Natural Language Processing library that can be used for various tasks. It has built-in methods for Named Entity Recognition. Spacy has a fast statistical entity recognition system.

 We can use spacy very easily for NER tasks. Though often we need to train our own data for business-specific needs, the spacy model general performs well for all types of text data.
